## Command line arguments

| Argument&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&ensp; | What it does |
| -----------------: | -------------- |
| `<empty>`          | Launches SKIF. |
| `Start`            | Launches SKIF and starts an instance of the injection service. |
| `Temp`             | Used with `Start` to indicate the injection service should auto-stop after a successful injection. |
| `Stop`             | Stops running instances of the injection service. Can also be used to attempt to force-eject leftover injections of Special K.  |
| `Quit`             | Closes running instances of SKIF. |
| `Minimize`         | Launches SKIF minimized *or* minimizes any running instances of SKIF, to the taskbar or notification area depending on configuration. |
| `"<path>.exe"`     | Uses SKIF as a launcher to start the injection service, launch another application, and then stop the service. Any arguments specified after the path is proxied to the launched application. Called through `SKIF %COMMAND%` from within the Steam client. |
| `AddGame="<path>"` | **Experimental!** Adds the specified application to the library of SKIF as a custom game. |
| `RestartDisplDrv`  | **Requires elevation!** Restarts the display driver (useful as this can sometimes fix MPOs). |
